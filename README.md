# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Using OWID Data

This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data (OWID). It tracks key pandemic metrics such as confirmed cases, deaths, vaccinations, testing, and recent trends across countries and continents, providing actionable insights into the ongoing pandemic dynamics.

## Objectives

- Analyze the global spread and impact of COVID-19 using up-to-date OWID data.
- Uncover meaningful insights related to cases, deaths, vaccinations, and testing.
- Visualize pandemic trends over time and across regions for better understanding.
- Identify emerging hotspots and evaluate vaccination progress worldwide.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.13.3 
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization and plotting  
- Jupyter Notebook: Interactive code execution and documentation  

## How to Run/View the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker.git
## Insights and Reflections
1. Continental Impact: Different continents show varying levels of COVID-19 cases per million population, with some regions significantly more affected, reflecting different pandemic trajectories and responses.

2. Vaccination Progress: Countries leading in full vaccination percentages tend to report fewer new COVID-19 cases per million, suggesting vaccinesâ€™ role in controlling the spread.

3. Vaccination vs New Cases Correlation: A negative correlation exists between vaccination rates and new cases per million over recent weeks, highlighting vaccine effectiveness at population level.

4. Mortality Rates: Some countries experience high deaths per million, indicating healthcare system challenges or differences in variant impact and public health measures.

5. Testing Efficiency: Test positivity rates reveal countries where testing may be insufficient or outbreaks are worsening, emphasizing the need for robust testing infrastructures.

6. Emerging Hotspots: The project identifies countries with sharp recent increases in new cases, signaling emerging waves or outbreaks requiring urgent public health attention.
